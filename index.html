            The name of the groundbreaking concept vehicle stands not only for
            the close collaboration in developing the show car together with the
            AVATAR team but also for ADVANCED VEHICLE TRANSFORMATION. This
            concept vehicle embodies the vision of Mercedes-Benz designers,
            engineers and trend researchers for mobility in the distant future.

              With its four high-performance and near-wheel-built electric
              motors, the VISION AVTR embodies a particularly agile
              implementation of the vision of a dynamic luxury saloon. With a
              combined engine power of more than 350 kW, the VISION AVTR sets a
              new benchmark for EQ Power.
            </p>
            <p class="premier__text">
              Thanks to the intelligent and fully variable torque distribution,
              the power of the four fully individually controllable motors is
              not only managed in the best possible way in terms of driving
              dynamics, but above all in a highly efficient manner.
            </p>
            <p class="premier__text">
              The innovative all-wheel drive with torque vectoring enables
              completely new freedoms and guarantees driving dynamics at the
              highest level while at the same time providing the best possible
              active safety.

              This means that each wheel can be driven separately and depending
              on the driving situation. Due to the possibility to drive the
              front and rear axles simultaneously or in opposite ways, the
              VISION AVTR can move sideways by approx. 30 degrees, in contrast
              to conventional vehicles. The so-called “crab movement” gives the
              concept vehicle a reptile-like appearance even in its movement.

            <p class="design__cell-text">
              For the first time, Mercedes-Benz has worked with a completely new
              design approach in the design of the VISION AVTR. The holistic
              concept combines the design disciplines interior, exterior and UX
              from the first sketch. Man and human perception are the starting
              point of a design process from the inside out.
            </p>
            <p class="design__cell-text">
              The design process begins with the experience of the passengers
              and consciously focuses on the perception and needs of the
              passengers. The goal was to create a car that prolongs the
              perception of its passengers. It was also a matter of creating an
              immersive experience space in which passengers connect with each
              other, with the vehicle and the surrounding area in a unique way.
            </p>
            <p class="design__cell-text">
              Large areas such as the back shell of the seat and the sky are
              decorated with a colour-changing fabric inspired by the colour
              world of the sea. Depending on the light, the textile changes its
              colour from dark blue to a subtle light blue. These seats are
              refined by the vegan DINAMICA® leather. DINAMICA® is the first and
              only microfibre that guarantees environmental sustainability
              throughout the entire production cycle.
            </p>
            <p class="design__cell-text">
              It is recycled material made from old clothing, flags and PET
              plastic bottles. During production, attention is paid to low
              pollutant emissions and low energy consumption. Thanks to its
              versatility, maximum performance and high quality, DINAMICA® is
              suitable for use in luxurious car interiors. It also guarantees
              slip resistance for passengers on the seats. The softness of the
              material gives the occupants a “welcome home” feeling.
            </p>
          </div>
          <img class="design__iterior" src="images/design1.jpg" alt="" />
          <div class="design__cell-two">
            <p class="design__cell-text">
              The VISION AVTR already responds to the approach of the passengers
              by visualising the energy and information flow of the environment
              with digital neurons that flow through the grille through the
              wheels to the rear area. The first interaction in the interior
              between man and vehicle happens completely intuitively via the
              control unit: by placing the hand on the centre console, the
              interior comes to life and the vehicle recognises the driver by
              his breathing. The innovative all-wheel drive with torque
              vectoring enables completely new freedoms and guarantees driving
              dynamics at the highest level while at the same time providing the
              best possible active safety.
